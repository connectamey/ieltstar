        The Reading component consists of 40 questions. A variety of question
        types is used in order to test a wide range of reading skills. These
        include reading for gist, reading for main ideas, reading for detail,
        skimming, understanding logical arguments and recognising writers’
        opinions, attitudes and purpose. <br />
        <br />
        The General Training version requires test takers to read extracts from
        books, magazines, newspapers, notices, advertisements, company handbooks
        and guidelines. These are materials you are likely to encounter on a
        daily basis in an English-speaking environment.
